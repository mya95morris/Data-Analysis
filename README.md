# Data Analysis Projects
Unfortunately, I'm not able to share many of the datasets that I've worked with due to the sensitivity of the clients' confidential information. Because of this, I decided to work with some public datasets that interested me. Here is where I plan to display the datasets I've analyzed and visualizations I've created. I'm extremely passionate about data and how it can be applied to make predictions that can be used to improve processes.
Libraries used : Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.


## Google Play Store Analyses
  This dataset is from Kaggle. I was able to analyze and visualize a dataset of 10,000 Google Play Store apps. 
  [This](https://github.com/mya95morris/Data-Analysis/commit/cabbb62c8e5a63c2cb9e186b7960487e1097373a) was the first analysis I did of this data.
  [Here](https://github.com/mya95morris/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Another_Google_Play_Store_Analysis.ipynb) is another analysis I performed with the same data.
  
  ## What's next?
  Next, I plan to analyze datasets about a topic I love (and in which I'm most likely apart of the data), beauty products! This industry truly amazes me, as I've seen sales and products SKYROCKET with the rise of social media beauty influencers. While I'm not one to spend hours on hair and makeup, I often find myself (and my spending patterns) enthralled by and influenced by the gorgeous people who are!
